The topic of design responsibility came up, possibly brought up by one of my designers, I honestly donâ€™t remember the details. What I do remember is that at some point in the discussion I raised my hand and suggested, to this group of designers, that modern design problems were very complex. And we ought to need a license to solve them.";
